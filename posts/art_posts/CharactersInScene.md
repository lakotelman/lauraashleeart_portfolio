# The goal is to create an illustrated movie moment.

Using a Skillshare course from Marianna Madriz, I had the opportunity to practice incorporating characters into their environments, rather than just placing them on top.

### Here are the steps I followed:

- Take inspiration in films and/or my own photographs to observe what makes a good scene.
- Using my own reference images to build my illustration.
- Thumbnailing a composition through simple shapes and lines.
- Test character positions and object placements whilst sketching.
- Using digital brushes to detail the final linework and add texture.
- Picking a limited colour palette.
- Sectionalising areas in your illustration to colour, considering foreground and background.
